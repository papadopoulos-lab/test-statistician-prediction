# Test: Prediction

This is a test of the statistical and programming skills required to undertake a prediction study.

You must complete this task in R.

## Scenario

You are trying to create a prediction model for the outcome "has Disease X". There are 2000 variables that can be considered for this model.

## Data

To investigate this, you have access to one data file inside the folder "data_raw":

1. data.xlsx (contains 1 000 people, 1 outcome variable, and 2000 exposure variables)
   - Outcome: 0/1 (0 = doesn't have Disease X, 1 = has Disease X)
   - Exposure_1, ..., Exposure_2000: Potential exposure variables.

## Instructions

1. Write an R script that creates a prediction model for the outcome "has Disease X" and evaluates this model.

2. Produce a written document (maximum length 2 pages) that contains the following sections:

- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions
- Tables (maximum 2, does not count towards page limit)
- Figures (maximum 2, does not count towards page limit)

## Deliverables

Send the:

-   R Script.
-   Written document.

To the requested email address.
